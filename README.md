# Employees' Likelihood to Stay or Leave After Training

## 📌 Overview
EdTech companies invest heavily in training programs before offering permanent roles. However, not all trainees remain with the company post-training. To optimize training costs and improve employee retention, this project identifies key factors that influence a candidate’s decision to stay or seek new employment.

## 🎯 Objective
The primary objective of this project is to predict whether a trainee will stay with the company or leave after completing the training program. The project aims to:
- Identify the key factors that influence employee retention.
- Build a classification model to predict whether a trainee is likely to leave or stay.
- Provide actionable business insights to reduce turnover and optimize training investment.

## 🛠️ Methodology
- **Algorithms Used:** XGBoost, Random Forest, AdaBoost
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Feature Engineering:** City Development Index, Company Size, Company Type, Demographics, and Experience Data
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Most Influential Features:**
  - City Development Index
  - Company Size (1000-4999 employees)
  - Company Type (Private Ltd.)
- **Demographic Trends:**
  - Candidates from underdeveloped cities are more likely to switch jobs.
  - Freshers with no relevant experience exhibit a higher likelihood of leaving.
  - Employees from early-stage startups, public sector, or NGOs tend to switch more compared to private sector employees.
  - Employees from larger companies (1000+ employees) often seek new opportunities, possibly for career advancement.

## 📊 Business Insights & Recommendations
- Prioritize candidates from underdeveloped cities who meet job role requirements to enhance retention.
- Promote diversity by hiring from underrepresented demographics who are more likely to switch jobs.
- Retain freshers by offering structured career development opportunities.
- Provide better growth incentives for employees transitioning from startups, NGOs, or public sector roles.
- Understand motivations behind job changes for employees from large corporations (1000+ employees) and tailor retention strategies accordingly.

# Employee Attrition Prediction

## 📌 Overview
McCurr Consultancy, a multinational company, seeks to minimize employee turnover and optimize retention strategies. High attrition rates lead to increased costs and disruption in operations. This project builds a predictive model to identify employees at risk of attrition and provides actionable insights to enhance retention efforts.

## 🎯 Objective
- Identify key drivers of employee attrition.
- Build a machine learning model to predict which employees are likely to leave.
- Develop data-driven retention strategies to improve employee satisfaction and reduce turnover.

## 🛠️ Methodology
- **Algorithms Used:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, ROC-AUC Score, Precision, Recall
- **Feature Engineering:** Monthly Income, Overtime, Age, Distance from Home, Work-related Travel
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

📂 [Project Notebook](https://github.com/MichelleT-Portfolio/Human-Resource_Industry/blob/main/HR_Satisfaction_Attrition.ipynb)

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Most Influential Factors for Attrition:**
  - Monthly Income (Lower salaries correlate with higher attrition rates)
  - Overtime (Employees working overtime have a higher likelihood of leaving)
  - Age (Younger employees tend to switch jobs more frequently)
  - Distance from Home (Longer commutes contribute to higher attrition)
  - Work-related Travel (Higher travel frequency increases attrition risk)
- **Training Impact:** Surprisingly, training programs do not significantly influence employee retention, suggesting a need for more targeted interventions.

## 📊 Business Insights & Recommendations
- **Compensation:** Ensure competitive salaries to retain talent.
- **Overtime Management:** Reduce excessive workloads and offer incentives for overtime employees.
- **Employee Engagement for Younger Workforce:** Foster a positive work environment with career growth opportunities.
- **Commute Assistance:** Provide travel support such as cab facilities for employees with long commutes.
- **Reassess Training Programs:** Investigate the effectiveness of training initiatives and align them with retention strategies.
- **Sales Department Focus:** The highest attrition is observed in the sales department; further research is needed to improve retention strategies in this area.
